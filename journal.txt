# This is a journal of my daily practice

March 6
11 am	-Started with a git push commit but my trouble already started 
trying to find  the txt thru the command line as i couldnt remember the 
commands to get there. After about 5 minutes i figured it out but then i needed a 
quick run thru of how to push a commit onto github. all in all it took 
me about 30 minutes to do all that

1110 am	-Made this journal.txt file to write about my practice. I made a new 
txt file and that went smooth. This new commit was easier as i just went 
thru thr refresher of the git commands. 

1120 am -Boilerplate practice. Its advised to try to remember the basic html format of a webpage as it will be used lots
Wrote the boilerplate 3 times but i for now do not have it memorized.
    #"!" shortcut was not working, the command to autmatically display the html boilerplate format.

1155 am Starting more html practice thru TOP curriculum. 

March 8
7 pm    -Starting the day by committing a journal entry as my daily git push practice. So a commit will not be updated for the "daily git practice"
I am still working on basic html practices. I am learning how to insert correct heading, paragraph, strong(bold)element, em(italics)element, and also learning what nesting and indentations are.
Working thru my practice webpage and practcing writing correct tags for the headings, paragraphs, etc.

730 pm  -Learning and practcing doing tags for making a list on you webpage. there are two different tags <ul> which is unordered list and <ol> which is ordered list.
Came to a barricade but i quickly figured out why. I was not ending my tags like how you are suppose to and the webpage was not looking correct.

8 pm    -The next lesson is inserting links and embedding images to your webpage. There are two types of links, absolute (links to other webpages) and relative (links to pages on own wepsite)
The link lesson is pretty straight forward and it did have an assasingment with a refresher on how to make directories and moving files to a new directory. It took me a small bit of time but i figured it out.

830 pm  -Learning how to insert images onto your html webpage with the image tag <img>
Images don't need end tags and they can be both relative or absolute path. Learned more about parent directories and how to add filepaths. It is a bit confusing but with more practice i think i can get it done.
There is also "alt attribute," words used to descibe the image if it doesn't load or to help visually impaired users who need screen readers.
