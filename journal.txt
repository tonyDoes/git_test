# This is a journal of my daily practice

March 6
11 am	-Started with a git push commit but my trouble already started 
trying to find  the txt thru the command line as i couldnt remember the 
commands to get there. After about 5 minutes i figured it out but then i needed a 
quick run thru of how to push a commit onto github. all in all it took 
me about 30 minutes to do all that

1110 am	-Made this journal.txt file to write about my practice. I made a new 
txt file and that went smooth. This new commit was easier as i just went 
thru thr refresher of the git commands. 

1120 am -Boilerplate practice. Its advised to try to remember the basic html format of a webpage as it will be used lots
Wrote the boilerplate 3 times but i for now do not have it memorized.
    #"!" shortcut was not working, the command to autmatically display the html boilerplate format.

1155 am Starting more html practice thru TOP curriculum.
