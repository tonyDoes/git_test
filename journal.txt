# This is a journal of my daily practice

March 6
	-Started with a git push commit but my trouble already started 
fig the txt thru the command line as i couldnt remember the commands to 
get there. After about 5 minutes i figured it out but then i needed a 
quick run thru of how to push a commit onto github. all in all it took 
me about 30 minutes to do all that
